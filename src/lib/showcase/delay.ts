 * important `animation` shorthand also declares an important `animation-delay`
 * of zero, and that beats any inline one — so every stagger set through
 * `style={{ animationDelay }}` silently did nothing. The shorthand reads this
 * custom property instead, and a custom property set inline does win.
 *
 * Counted from the end of the scene change, not from the scene boundary: the
 * layer adds the hold that lets the old picture dissolve before new text
 * arrives.
